The bubble game

In this game, you are a bubble trying to survive. Fish that come in contact with you make you lose air in your bubble. You need to shoot projectile bubbles at them to keep them away. If a fish is hit by a bubble, it will immediately flee. Be careful though. It takes air to shoot bubbles. If you run out of air, you lose. If you can successfully scare off all the fish, you win.

To play:
Press enter to start, move with wasd, and shoot with the left click on the mouse. Bubbles will go where your mouse is pointed.
